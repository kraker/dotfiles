anaveragehuman has posted a new topic 'Using aur helper with /tmp mounted noexec' in the forum 'Newbie Corner', to which you are subscribed.

The topic is located at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=207961

The message reads as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm currently using apacman, a fork of packer(-color) as an AUR helper. I've noticed that it fails sometimes when trying to run scripts while building.
After searching the forums, I've found that the noexec option in my /etc/fstab is the most likely cause of this.
I had personally put in the noexec flag as I had heard it would make my system more secure by disallowing malware to run from /tmp.

Two questions:
    Is there a way to allow execution of scripts in /tmp for only apacman?
    If not, is it a risky thing to allow exec in /tmp? Would you turn it off?
