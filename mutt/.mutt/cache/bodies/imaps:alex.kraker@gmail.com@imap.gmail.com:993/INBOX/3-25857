I think the Debussy is my favorite, actually (at least at the moment!).  I
listened to it on my drive in to my appointment yesterday morning. The
third movement especially seemed to speak to how I was feeling all weekend.
 :)  I've been hard pressed to find a recording I like as well as Trio
Fontenay's on YouTube, though that could just be me being biased towards
the first recording I heard... This one's alright, though:
