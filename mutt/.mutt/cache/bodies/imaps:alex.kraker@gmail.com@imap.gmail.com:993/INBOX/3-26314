Kirkx has posted a new topic 'Fallback Video Driver for Xorg Server v1.18' in the forum 'Newbie Corner', to which you are subscribed.

The topic is located at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=207866

The message reads as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a very basic system with only the following packages installed

- base
- base-devel
- xorg (xorg-server, xorg-server-utils, xorg-xinit, xorg-twm, xorg-xclock, xterm)

Before installing the nouveau or nvidia-340xx driver (for my GeForce 8500 GT card) I would like to try running the system using only the fallback video driver, just to see what it feels like.

Question #1

What is the official/preferred fallback driver for xorg v1.18? According to Xorg wiki it is xf86-video-vesa but this information seems to be outdated ("Driver installation" section):

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg]

The vesa driver apparently doesn't work with xorg after v1.15:

[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=186905]

The fallback drivers suggested on the thread quoted above are:

xf86-video-modesetting
xf86-video-fbdev

The modesetting driver apparently conflicts with xorg-server 1.18.0-4:

[https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/xorg-server/]

So the right fallback driver seems to be xf86-video-fbdev. Is this conclusion correct or have I missed somthing?

Question #2

Assuming that xf86-video-fbdev is indeed the best fallback driver, how can you confirm that it is properly loaded on startup?

lspci command incorrectly identifies the driver as nouveau although noveau is not even installed on the system:

lspci -k | grep VGA -A 2

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation G86 [GeForce 8500 GT] (rev a1)
	Subsystem: eVga.com. Corp. Device c793
	Kernel driver in use: nouveau

pacman -Qi nouveau
error: package 'nouveau' was not found 

This probably happens because mesa and mesa-libgl were pulled as dependencies during xorg installation and they are usually used together with nouveau:

pacman -Qs nouveau
local/mesa 11.1.1-1
an open-source implementaion of the OpenGL specification 

The command below confirms that xf86-video-fbdev is really installed:

pacman -Qs xf86-video-fbdev
local/xf86-video-fbdev 0.4.4-5 (xorg-drivers xorg)
X.Org framebuffer video driver
