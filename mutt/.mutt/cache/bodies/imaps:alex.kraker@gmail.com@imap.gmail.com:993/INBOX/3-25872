Dearest Alexander,

I was very sorry to hear tonight that you are not coming to celebrate
Christmas with us.  I do hope you are well and wish you peace and comfort
and joy during this holiday season.

We have your usual stocking and some small gifts that we were hoping you
would be here to open and share Christmas morning with Sam, Eliza and
Grandma Cookie.  I understand that you have made other plans.  If you would
like me to send them home with Grandma Cookie maybe you could arrange to
open them with her sometime next week.  It's just a few things that I
always put in all of your stockings every year and a couple of small things
we thought you might enjoy.

We are hosting another holiday get-together on New Year's day for the Hill
side of the family.  I hope you can come to that one if you are able and
celebrate with us in our new home.

It would be heartwarming to see you again.  It's been a long time.  We love
you and we miss you.

With much love from,

Mom and Dad
