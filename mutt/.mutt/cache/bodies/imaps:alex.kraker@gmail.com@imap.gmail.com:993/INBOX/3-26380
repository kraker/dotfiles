Kemikal has posted a new topic 'Unable to connect to wireless device' in the forum 'Newbie Corner', to which you are subscribed.

The topic is located at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=207958

The message reads as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The device I have is a T-LINK TL-WN823N wifi dongle.

This device worked out of the box with the rtl8291cu driver included in the kernel.

However, it would disconnect every 1-5 minutes, and I would have to disconnect it and reconnect it.

The wiki ([https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#rtl8192cu]) suggests that I try the AUR package for the driver. [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/8192cu-dkms/]

I installed the AUR package and it worked.

However, now I have upgraded from linux 4-3.3.2 to linux 4-3.3.3, it doesn't work any more.

Some sanity checks:

$ pacman -Qi linux

It is enp0s20u5:

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 40:8d:5c:7e:0e:9e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: enp0s20u5: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 60:e3:27:17:90:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

I see that the state is DOWN, so I tried to make it UP:

$ sudo ip link set enp0s20u5 up
(This returned no output)

$ iw dev
(This returned no output)

What do I need to do to make it work?
