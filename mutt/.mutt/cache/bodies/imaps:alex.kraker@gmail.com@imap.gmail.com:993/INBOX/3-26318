The message reads as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a very strange problem with Pulseaudio.  When the profile of the sound card is changed, it would revert back to "Analog Stereo Duplex", which causes sound defects. This ocures only on my integrated audio card however on my gpu with hdmi it stays the same. I dont have any problems when using only ALSA. I tried to launch pulseaudio with -vvvv but wasn't able to find the source of the problem. Here is the log: [http://pastebin.com/pRMb5FEB]. Sory for my bad english.
