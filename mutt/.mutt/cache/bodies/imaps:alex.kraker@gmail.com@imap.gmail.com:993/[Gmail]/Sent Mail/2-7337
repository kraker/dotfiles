What do you need in terms of the site and your marketing person? I am kind  
of in the middle of big project, but I also wouldn't want to hold things up  
for you. We can get started on it if you need and I would work on it as I  
have time. I've been thinking about it.

Your right there's so much we could accomplish together... It goes way  
beyond the site. My main question is what do you need the site to 'do?'

How would you feel about doing weekly training sessions for now? Could  
change later...

Don't need any money just yet to start work on the site but would be  
interested in money after things get rolling.

Also at some point it would be awesome to collaborate musically but there's  
not really room for that for me at present.

Let's talk. Get together and smoke soon? I could come to you.

I think you would love this book. Funniest shit I've read in a while. You  
remind me of the black dude who busts this guys ass for 31 days. He's  
unreal.



Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet



Here's a link to an excerpt:

http://www.the100mileman.com/s/Living-with-a-Seal_Intro-and-Ch-1.pdf



As far as the website goes, I think using the content you have we should do  
a whole redesign of the site from scratch using a more modern up to date  
platform. It would be some work. I'd love to work on it though.
